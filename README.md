My personal website.  
It is a simple showcase of my projects and interests.

A little bit of everything, from programming to research, from music to travel.  
I'm planning to add something about gaming and photography too.

Usually I update the website when I am bored or when I have something new to show.  
Maybe you will find something interesting here, maybe not. Hope you enjoy it anyway.
